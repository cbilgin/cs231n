# cs231n
===============

Here are my assignment solutions for cs231n (Spring 2017). The course website: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/ 

I want to thank Stanford for making the lecture note, video and assignment available to all the people worldwide! This is truely a great course if you want to learn Convolutional Neural Networks and have a little stat or cs background. I myself feel so fruitful taking this!

For GPU based homework, Stanford made two choices:
* PyTorch
* Tensorflow

All my current solutions are subject to Tensorflow. All assignment should be completed and passed the test set.

If there is any errors or typo (or better solution!!!) please inform me!

Assignment list:

 * Assignment #1
 	* Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (20 points)
 	* Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (25 points)
 	* Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (20 points)
